## Loading and preprocessing the data
First we load the data via readr. It is stored in a variable called 'activity'.
```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(readr)
activity <- read_csv("activity.csv")
```
 Let's have a look at the first 10 lines after reading the dataset.
 ```{r}
head(activity)
```
/## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}

```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
